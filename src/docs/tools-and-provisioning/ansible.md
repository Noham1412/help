# Ansible Module Documentation

Ansible is an open-source software provisioning, configuration management, and application-deployment tool enabling infrastructure as code.

Spot integration with Ansible enables you to use an Ansible module to create, update, and delete [resources](need to create a new page here) running with the Spot platform on AWS.

To install the Ansible module for Spot, go to the documentation on [Github](https://github.com/spotinst/spotinst-ansible-module).
